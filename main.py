We are creating a detailed prompt for an interactive Lean+SixSigma chatbot prototype.
The goal is to guide factory floor decision-making by:
    1. Identifying the user's industry,
    2. Choosing their framework of interest (TPS, FPS, SPW, LSS),
    3. Providing an interactive explanation of the chosen framework.
